CSC 435 Project Proposal

	The project idea that I would like to create is an application that simulate an online ordering for a restaurant named Fake Food. 
  There would be around five points of contacts with users using the api. 
  The first contact point is probably ordering where the user can order as a guest or logged in their own account. 
  The second contact point is logging in page to access their account and possibly have saved usual orders with it. 
  The third is probably the cart or checkout page that would have take information for payments. 
  The back-end functionality would have connection to a database to store a userâ€™s account and order. 
  Another is being able to complete an encrypted transaction. I would love to learn more about encryption. 
  The one I know currently is modulus encryption that I recently learned in the first couple of weeks of this semester. 
  There would be additional classes to store call and store usernames from the database. 
  Also store orders with the name of items and their prices. There is possibly addition that would be add to the api.
